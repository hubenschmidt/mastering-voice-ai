    "# Traditional Voice Interaction Pipeline Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Short Description\n",
    "This code demonstrates a sequential voice assistant pipeline with three decoupled modules: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Large Language Model (LLM) processing, and Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis. It illustrates the modular architecture and sequential execution flow of traditional voice assistants, highlighting both benefits and limitations discussed in lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Libraries Used\n",
    "- `speech_recognition`: For capturing audio and performing speech-to-text conversion\n",
    "- `transformers`: Provides access to the GPT-2 language model for text generation\n",
    "- `gtts`: Google Text-to-Speech API interface for speech synthesis\n",
    "- `playsound`: For audio playback of generated responses\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Logic and Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-Level Overview\n",
    "The script implements a strictly sequential pipeline where:\n",
    "1. Audio input is captured through the microphone and converted to text\n",
    "2. The transcribed text is processed by a language model to generate a response\n",
    "3. The text response is converted to speech and played through speakers\n",
    "The execution flows unidirectionally with no feedback mechanisms between stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Flowchart\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "flowchart TD\n",
    "    A[Start] --> B[Capture Audio]\n",
    "    B --> C{ASR Success?}\n",
    "    C -->|Yes| D[Process Text with LLM]\n",
    "    C -->|No| E[Generate Error Message]\n",
    "    D --> F[Convert Text to Speech]\n",
    "    E --> F\n",
    "    F --> G[Play Audio]\n",
    "    G --> H[Cleanup Resources]\n",
    "    H --> I[End]\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Step-by-Step Code Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Captures live audio input through the microphone\n",
    "\n",
    "    Performs ambient noise reduction for better accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sends audio to Google's speech recognition API\n",
    "\n",
    "    Handles two primary error cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Unrecognizable audio (returns None)\n",
    "\n",
    "        Service connection errors (returns None)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Returns transcribed text or error indicator\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Large Language Model (LLM) Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "    Validates ASR output before processing\n",
    "\n",
    "    Constructs conversational prompt incorporating user input\n",
    "\n",
    "    Uses GPT-2 model to generate contextual response\n",
    "\n",
    "    Extracts first relevant line from model output\n",
    "\n",
    "    Provides fallback message for invalid inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "    Demonstrates text-only processing (no audio context)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Text-to-Speech (TTS) Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "    Converts text response to spoken audio\n",
    "\n",
    "    Uses Google's TTS service for speech generation\n",
    "\n",
    "    Saves generated audio to temporary file\n",
    "\n",
    "    Plays audio through system speakers\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cleans up temporary files post-playback\n",
    "\n",
    "    Demonstrates output-only conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pipeline Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "    Coordinates strict sequential execution of stages\n",
    "\n",
    "    ASR must complete before LLM processing starts\n",
    "\n",
    "    LLM must finish before TTS begins\n",
    "\n",
    "    No error recovery between stages\n",
    "\n",
    "    Shows linear waterfall execution pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connecting to the Lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation concretely demonstrates the traditional pipeline architecture discussed in lecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Modular Separation: Clear boundaries between ASR, LLM, and TTS components\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sequential Processing: Strict stage-by-stage execution creates latency accumulation\n",
    "\n",
    "    Error Propagation: ASR failures directly impact downstream components\n",
    "\n",
    "    Context Loss: Prosody and emotional cues are stripped during ASR conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "    Temporary Artifacts: File-based handling between components increases latency\n",
    "\n",
    "The code intentionally shows architectural constraints that modern end-to-end SpeechLMs address through integrated audio-to-audio processing, preserving paralinguistic features and enabling real-time feedback.    "
